Clone the repository and set up both applications. For the backend, navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies, create your .env file, and run npm run dev. For the frontend, head to the frontend directory, install dependencies, add your Mapbox token to .env.local, and launch with npm run dev. Make sure MongoDB is running locally. Access the application at localhost:3000, register a new account, and start uploading your GeoJSON files to visualize them on the interactive map. The backend API will be available at localhost:8000.
